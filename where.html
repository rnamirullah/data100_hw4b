            <p>Hulu is only offered in the United States, but Netflix has a global presence.
                However, that has to do with viewers, not creators. Where is content made?</p>
            <div class="flex">
            <img src = "img/waffle_Netflix.png"alt = "Where Netflix content is made" class = "center">

            <p>Netflix leverages international creators, with nearly 60% of its content from 2017-
                2021 created entirely outside of the United States, or by international creators in
                partnership with the United States. Unfortunately, much of the information on the
                origin of programs is missing for Hulu in the data set. However, from the data we
                do have, we see that a larger percentage of content was produced exclusively in the
                United States (30%) versus content with an international component (19%).</p>
